# GetGameYear
A program to return the Year and PCGaming Wiki URL for a game.

The program works by manual input or drag & drop of a folder.

Manual input can be typing a game title or path or pasting such.
Drag & Drop is available through the Viewer with a small floating DROPBOX.

A viewer is provided, which lists all added games, and has various helpful features, including reducing the need for manual editing.
